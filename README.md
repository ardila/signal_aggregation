signal_aggregation is about combining art via generative processes and learning.

To get this running all you should need to do is clone it, go to that folder in matlab and type

```
Generate

Generate.m explains the overall structure of what's going on, so read that first.

Init explains in slightly more detail parameters you can change to get different results.

Let us know if you have any issues, or want us to explain something
